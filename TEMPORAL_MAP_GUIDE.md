# Weather Channel Style Time-Lapse Map

## 🎬 What You Just Got

You now have a **Weather Channel style time-lapse map** that shows air quality and atmospheric patterns moving across time, just like weather radar shows storms moving!

## 🚀 How to Use It

### 1. **Access the Time-Lapse**
- Go to your Dashboard
- Click the **"Time-Lapse Map"** tab (with the clock icon)
- The map will load showing NASA satellite data

### 2. **Watch Patterns Move**
- Click the **Play button** ▶️ to start the animation
- Watch as air quality patterns move across the map over time
- See pollution, fires, and atmospheric conditions change hour by hour

### 3. **Control the Animation**
- **Play/Pause**: Start and stop the time-lapse
- **Step Forward/Back**: Move one time frame at a time
- **Speed Control**: Choose 0.5x to 4x playback speed
- **Scrub Timeline**: Click anywhere on the progress bar to jump to that time
- **Reset**: Jump back to the beginning

### 4. **Switch Data Layers**
Choose what you want to see moving across time:

- **🛰️ Satellite**: True color satellite imagery
- **💨 Aerosols**: Air pollution and particles (this is the main air quality layer!)
- **⚡ Ozone**: Ozone layer data
- **🏭 NO₂**: Nitrogen dioxide from traffic and industry
- **🔥 Fires**: Active fire detections

### 5. **Change Dates**
- Use the date selector to view different days
- Goes back 7 days to show historical patterns
- Each day shows 8 time frames (every 3 hours)

## 🎯 What You'll See

### **Aerosol Layer** (Main Air Quality)
- **Dark areas**: Clean air
- **Bright/colored areas**: Higher pollution
- **Moving patterns**: Pollution being blown by wind
- **Hotspots**: Cities, industrial areas, fires

### **Time Progression**
- **12:00 AM → 6:00 AM**: Nighttime patterns
- **6:00 AM → 12:00 PM**: Morning rush hour effects
- **12:00 PM → 6:00 PM**: Daytime heating and activity
- **6:00 PM → 12:00 AM**: Evening patterns

### **Movement Patterns**
- **Wind Direction**: See pollution move with wind patterns
- **Urban Plumes**: City pollution spreading outward
- **Fire Smoke**: Wildfire smoke traveling across regions
- **Seasonal Effects**: Different patterns by time of year

## 🌟 Cool Things to Look For

1. **Morning Rush Hour**: Watch NO₂ spike around cities at 6-9 AM
2. **Fire Smoke**: See wildfire smoke traveling hundreds of miles
3. **Wind Patterns**: Pollution moving in consistent directions
4. **Urban Heat Islands**: Cities affecting surrounding air quality
5. **Coastal Effects**: Ocean vs. land air quality differences
6. **Industrial Plumes**: Factories and power plants creating visible pollution

## 📱 Tips for Best Experience

- **Start with Aerosols**: This shows air quality most clearly
- **Use 1x or 2x speed**: Too fast and you'll miss the patterns
- **Try different dates**: Each day has unique patterns
- **Zoom in/out**: See both local and regional patterns
- **Watch multiple loops**: Patterns become clearer with repetition

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Data Source**: NASA GIBS (Global Imagery Browse Services)
- **Update Frequency**: Every 3 hours
- **Coverage**: Global
- **Resolution**: Up to 1km for some layers
- **Latency**: 1-3 hours behind real-time

## 🎉 What Makes This Special

This is exactly like what you see on The Weather Channel, but for **air quality instead of weather**! You can now:

- **See pollution move** like you see storms move
- **Track air quality patterns** across your region
- **Understand wind effects** on air quality
- **Spot pollution sources** and how they spread
- **Plan activities** based on moving air quality patterns

The animation shows you not just current conditions, but **how they're changing and where they're going** - just like weather radar for air quality!

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Try it now**: Go to the Time-Lapse Map tab
2. **Experiment**: Try different layers and dates
3. **Share**: Show others how air quality moves in your area
4. **Learn**: Use it to understand air quality patterns

You now have a powerful tool to visualize and understand air quality like never before! 🌍✨
